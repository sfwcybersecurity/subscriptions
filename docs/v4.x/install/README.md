# Attach Subscriptions to model

**Laravel Subby** has been specially made for Eloquent. To add Subscription functionality to your User model just use
the `\sfwcybersecurity\subscriptions\Traits\HasSubscriptions` trait like this:

```php
namespace App\Models;

use sfwcybersecurity\subscriptions\Traits\HasSubscriptions;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasSubscriptions;
}
```

That's it, we only have to use that trait in our User model or any other model! Now your users may subscribe to plans.
Then you can import package's models wherever you need them or extend them in your own models.
